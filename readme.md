# At the time of writing (10th of Dezember 2021) this is still work in progress. There is a likelyhood of errors that have not been found yet. If you like to live on the bleeding edge go ahead if you like security wait until offical confirmation that the adapter works as intended!

## Test report

* PWM Driver - ok with external pullup and adjusted timings see `config.h`
* Serial Half-duplex - ok at default speed and up to 3.75MBit/s see `config.h`
* SPI EEPROM - ok, PWM3360 - ok from scope, should work with real hardware
* Splithand detection - ok
* Bootloader bodge - ok, can enter reliably everytime
* Matrix - ok
